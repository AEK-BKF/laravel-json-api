# cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api

Add [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org) compliant APIs to your Laravel 5 application. 
Based on the framework agnostic packages [neomerx/json-api](https://github.com/neomerx/json-api) 
and [cloudcreativity/json-api](https://github.com/cloudcreativity/json-api).

## What is JSON API?

From [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org)

> If you've ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON API is your anti-bikeshedding weapon.
>
> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application. Clients built around JSON API are able to take advantage of its features around efficiently caching responses, sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.

For full information on the spec, plus examples, see http://jsonapi.org

## Documentation

We're in the process of adding full documentation to the wiki. We'll also be adding a demo app.

## Status

This repository is under development. We have production applications that are using the package and extensive test
coverage of these applications.

The reason we have not tagged the package as `1.0` is because some features require refinement. You'll see from the
issues that there are plenty of suggestions from users of the package as to how to improve it. We might therefore
need to introduce breaking changes as we work on these improvements.

We are committed to providing [upgrade notes](UPGRADE.md) on each breaking change as we develop the package.
