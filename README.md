## What is JSON API?

From [jsonapi.org](http://jsonapi.org)

> If you've ever argued with your team about the way your JSON responses should be formatted, JSON API is your anti-bikeshedding weapon.
>
> By following shared conventions, you can increase productivity, take advantage of generalized tooling, and focus on what matters: your application. Clients built around JSON API are able to take advantage of its features around efficiently caching responses, sometimes eliminating network requests entirely.
