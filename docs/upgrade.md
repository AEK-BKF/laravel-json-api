# Upgrade Guide 

As we are currently on pre-1.0 releases, when you upgrade you will also need to specify that package
dependencies need to be upgraded. Use the following command:

```bash
$ composer require cloudcreativity/laravel-json-api:1.0.0-alpha.1 --update-with-dependencies
```

## Upgrading to 0.12 to 1.0.0-alpha.1
