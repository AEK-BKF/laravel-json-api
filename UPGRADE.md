## v0.3 to v0.4

This was a substantial reworking of the package based on our experience of using it in production environments.
You'll need to refactor your implementation, referring to the wiki documentation when we complete that.
Apologies if this is a lot of work, however we think this package has significantly improved. We're now on the 
path to v1.0 and we'll keep breaking changes to a minimum from this point onwards.
